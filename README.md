# travel-siteV2

Revisited the Udemy course "Git a Web Developer Job: Mastering the Modern Workflow" a year later.

Changed out sections that previously used floats - Our Features, Testimonials.. basically anything that used the 'row' class - and converted it all to flexbox. The only floats I did't convert at this time, was in the nav.
